There are Many Roles in Crikcet, like the Wicket Keeper who catches the Ball when the Batsman trying to hit the ball misses. The Batsman is the Person who hits the ball when the Bowler Throws the Ball. The Bowler is the Person who throws the ball to the Batsman. And last but not Least we have the fielder, The Fielder is the person who catches the ball or stops the ball and Throws it to the Wicket Keeper or the Bowler.
